# Replication of Willenbockel et al., study 1

This folder contains data obtained from a conceptual replication of Willenbockel et al. 2010 study 1.

The replication tests a new sampler as well as an implementation of image manipulation in JavaScript. The whole implementation
is accessible from https://github.com/dcousin3/bagel.

Note that the participant 'test' is for tests only and must be deleted prior to analyses.

Denis.
